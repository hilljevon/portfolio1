In my pursuit of contributing positively to mental health awareness, I architected and developed MentalShare, a full-stack social media application tailored to mental health discourse and support. Utilizing NextJS for the backend and MongoDB for database management, I ensured robust and scalable infrastructure. The frontend is crafted with React and TypeScript, integrated seamlessly with TailwindCSS for a responsive and intuitive user interface.

For user authentication and secure login, I implemented ClerkJS, offering users the convenience of signing in with their email and password or through their Google accounts. This feature not only enhances user experience but also fortifies the platform's security.
## Main Functionality

The core functionality of MentalShare allows users to create posts, engage with the community by liking and commenting on shared content, and interact in a supportive environment. 
Currently, the platform hosts a main page where all users converge, with plans underway to introduce specialized sub-forums. 
These upcoming features are designed to cater to specific mental health issues and solutions, fostering a more targeted and effective support network.

}
```

As the creator and developer of MentalShare, my role encompassed not just technical development but also a deep understanding of user needs in the sensitive area of mental health. 
This project stands as a testament to my ability to blend technical prowess with empathy and social awareness, aiming to make a meaningful impact in the digital space.
