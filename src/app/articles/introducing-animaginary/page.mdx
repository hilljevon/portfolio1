BrainBudget is a cutting-edge web application designed to enhance users' financial literacy by presenting their spending habits, subscriptions, and bills in an intuitive, graphical interface. This platform, developed using technologies like React, NextJS, and MongoDB, empowers users to track and analyze their financial health, fostering more informed and efficient spending decisions.


```js
import { animate } from '@planetaria/animaginary'

export function MyComponent({ open, children }) {
  return (
    <animate.div
      in={open}
      animateFrom="opacity-0 scale-95"
      animateTo="opacity-100 scale-100"
      duration={350}
    >
      {children}
    </animate.div>
  )
}
```

As the lead developer of BrainBudget, a sophisticated web application, I spearheaded the creation of a platform aimed at revolutionizing personal financial management. 
BrainBudget is engineered to foster financial literacy and responsibility, presenting users' spending data through an intuitive graphical interface, 
and offering comprehensive breakdowns of their subscriptions, bills, and income. The application addresses critical needs by:
1. Enhancing users' understanding of their spending patterns.
2. Simplifying the tracking of financial obligations.
3. Promoting transparency in spending habits to encourage efficient financial management.
## Key Developmental Milestones

1. Onboarding Process: Users undergo a detailed onboarding, inputting income and expenditure data, with an option to upload bank statements (currently supporting SchoolsFirst Credit Union) for comprehensive tracking. This data, including bills and subscriptions, is securely stored in a MongoDB database for persistent, hassle-free access.

2. User Dashboard: Post-onboarding, users access a dashboard featuring a summary of the latest 20 transactions and various navigational menus.

3. Spending Overview: Utilizing the ReCharts JS Library, the application displays user spending over the last 12 months and 10 weeks through clear, informative graphs.

4. Recurring Payments Analysis: Detailed graphical breakdowns show all recurring payments, categorizing them into monthly bills and subscriptions, and highlighting each paymentâ€™s percentage relative to the total.
```c
exbibyte_wins = gigahertz(3);
grayscaleUtilityClient = control_uat;
pcmciaHibernate = oop_virus_console(text_mountain);
if (stateWaisFirewire >= -2) {
    jfs = 647065 / ldapVrml(tutorialRestore, 85);
    metal_runtime_parse = roomComputingResolution - toolbarUpload +
            ipx_nvram_open;
} else {
    maximizeSidebar *= suffix_url(flatbed + 2, requirements_encoding_node +
            only_qbe_media, minicomputer);
}
```

## Upcoming Features:

1. Comparative spending graphs juxtaposing monthly and weekly expenses with income to identify potential financial imbalances.
2. Calculation of disposable income post-essential expenses, aiding users in making informed spending decisions.
3. Reminders for manual payment deadlines to avoid late fees and maintain financial discipline.

## Development Stack:
Regarding the technical architecture of BrainBudget, I employed ClerkJS for robust and secure user authentication, 
with future plans to integrate Google account authentication for enhanced user convenience. 
The backend of the application is powered by NextJS, ensuring the security and integrity of user data, while MongoDB serves as the database, 
efficiently managing user and transaction information. 
For the frontend, I opted for ReactJS coupled with TailwindCSS, creating an engaging and responsive user interface. 
Components are meticulously styled using a combination of raw TailwindCSS or ShadCN components. 
Additionally, the integration of ReactHookForm and ZodValidation streamlines form management, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.
